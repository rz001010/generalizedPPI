# PPI estimators under covariate distribution shift
This folder contain simulation scripts for PPI estimators under covariate distribution shift, in the context of Section 3.1, when the target is a summary of the full data distribution.

Simulations in Sections 6.2 can be replicated using the script in this folder.

- Script for Section 6.2 has code for generating Figures 3, 4, and S.7.
