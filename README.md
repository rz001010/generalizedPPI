# Generalized PPI, with Application to Binary Classifier Evaluation 
Scripts for the simulations and real data analysis in "Generalized Prediction-Powered Inference, with Application to Binary Classifier Evaluation " by Zou, Witten, and Williamson. Preprint: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10332).

Figures 1-4, S.1-S.7 and Table 1 can be generated using the scripts.

The function for computing the influence function of AUC is based on the code of the cvAUC R packge here: https://github.com/ledell/cvAUC.

The real data analysis is using wine quality data from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality.
